<p>TaskRabbit gives a portal to people in a particular area to post any household task they need help with and get it done by &#8220;taskers.&#8221; Furniture assembly, lifting and moving furniture, and even home and office deliveries are just some of the odd jobs you&#8217;ll find.</p>



<p>For every job you take, TaskRabbit will be charging the user – and not you – with their service fee and Trust and Support fee. So, if you posted an hourly rate of $20, you&#8217;d get all of the payment deposited in your bank account.</p>



<p>To become a tasker, you need to meet the following qualifications:</p>



<ul><li>At least 18 years old</li><li>Valid SSS number</li><li>Confirm your identity with an ID check. If you&#8217;re from California, you&#8217;ll need to submit proof that you&#8217;re a sole proprietor.</li><li>Must have a smartphone to run the TaskRabbit app</li></ul>



<p>To get started, you need to install the app and register. Then build your profile by specifying the services you specialize in and the location where you&#8217;ll operate. Submit your ID and SSS number to confirm your identity.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll have to shell out a one-time registration fee of $25 to finalize the application process. After paying, you can now set your work schedule.</p>



<p>Then, you can immediately start browsing for delivery jobs in your area. If a user wants to hire your services, the app will notify you as well.</p>



<p>Take note, though, that it can take up to five days before you receive payment in your bank account. While TaskRabbit approves payments within 24 hours of completing a task, it usually takes three to five days before Stripe transfers the money to your bank account.</p>



<p>TaskRabbit is one of the perfect gig economy apps if you live in a city with a large population since the demand for work is always high. As you continue fulfilling job orders, you can reach the rank of Elite Tasker, which allows you to get jobs without searching and bidding for them.</p>

<p>GigSmart is a marketplace connecting workers with businesses that need help with filling in shifts or additional manpower during peak hours. You&#8217;ll discover many ways to earn money through this portal – from hourly shift gigs to part-time and full-time jobs. The gigs you&#8217;ll find come from various industries, including delivery.</p>



<p>You won&#8217;t have to pay GigSmart any registration fee to start browsing for available jobs in your area. However, you&#8217;ll still need to complete the registration process and upload your picture before you can do so.</p>



<p>The requirements to get gigs from GigSmart are pretty straightforward:</p>



<ul><li>18 years or older</li><li>Legal authorization to work</li><li>Sign a legal contract</li><li>Pass DMV and background check</li></ul>



<p>GigSmart will charge you $1 for every hour to cover their services, which will also apply to your occupational accident insurance. You&#8217;ll have $10,000 coverage for accidental death and up to $90,000 for eligible dependents.</p>



<p>The dollar-per-hour charge may seem to be too much if your hourly rate is close to minimum wage. However, average hourly rates for delivery drivers are higher than minimum wage, so the charge shouldn&#8217;t hurt your income that much. Plus, having insurance as a courier is actually a welcome benefit.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll receive a payment within two weeks after finishing a job. But if you want faster payments, you can choose the instant transfer option – which will charge a 3% processing fee.</p>



<p>GigSmart is an excellent app if you want part-time or full-time delivery work. But depending on your area, work may not always be readily available. The good thing setting this marketplace apart from most apps is that you&#8217;ll have insurance coverage while on the job.</p>



<h2><strong>3. </strong><a href="https://flex.amazon.com/"><strong>Amazon Flex</strong></a><strong> – Best for an Easy Start</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://wordpress.getcircuit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/61d74111-b95e-45e9-96ed-28bd7ee5beb0-1024x593.jpg" alt="The 7 Best Gig Economy Apps for Couriers to Make More Money: Amazon Flex app" class="wp-image-3259" srcset="https://wordpress.getcircuit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/61d74111-b95e-45e9-96ed-28bd7ee5beb0-1024x593.jpg 1024w, https://wordpress.getcircuit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/61d74111-b95e-45e9-96ed-28bd7ee5beb0-300x174.jpg 300w, https://wordpress.getcircuit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/61d74111-b95e-45e9-96ed-28bd7ee5beb0-768x445.jpg 768w, https://wordpress.getcircuit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/61d74111-b95e-45e9-96ed-28bd7ee5beb0-1536x890.jpg 1536w, https://wordpress.getcircuit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/61d74111-b95e-45e9-96ed-28bd7ee5beb0-2048x1186.jpg 2048w, https://wordpress.getcircuit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/61d74111-b95e-45e9-96ed-28bd7ee5beb0-1200x695.jpg 1200w, https://wordpress.getcircuit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/61d74111-b95e-45e9-96ed-28bd7ee5beb0-1980x1147.jpg 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>A delivery gig from the nation&#8217;s largest online retail company is undoubtedly a great option. Amazon Flex is specially designed for people who want to earn money delivering packages to Amazon customers.</p>



<p>The app and registration are completely free. However, you won&#8217;t be able to specify your hourly rate. Amazon Flex drivers can earn from $18 to $25 per hour.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re a new delivery driver, this is an excellent side-hustle since you don&#8217;t even need any experience to get in.</p>



<p>To become accepted as an Amazon Flex driver, you need to meet the following requirements:</p>



<ul><li>21 years or older</li><li>Valid driver&#8217;s license</li><li>Smartphone to run the Amazon Flex app</li><li>A mid-sized vehicle, such as a four-door SUV, van, or pickup with a covered bed</li><li>Auto insurance</li></ul>



<p>The signup process is simple. However, due to background checks, it could take a week before you officially become their delivery driver.</p>



<p>Amazon sends you the available blocks you can fulfill through your app. Claiming blocks is a first-come, first-serve basis, and you&#8217;ll need to sign in to the app early to secure your delivery blocks.</p>



<p>Amazon Flex app will point you to the <a href="https://getcircuit.com/route-planner/blog/delivery-route-planner-apps">best route</a> you can take to reach your destination. After your delivery, you can start grabbing blocks again if there are still available ones on your shift.</p>



<p>Amazon pays their Flex drivers twice a week by depositing the money directly to their bank accounts. Considered one of the best gigs for drivers, Amazon Flex offers flexible work hours and a competitive hourly rate.</p>



<h2><strong>4. </strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://dolly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link"><strong>Dolly</strong></a><strong> – Best for Truck Owners</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://wordpress.getcircuit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/99c9baea-aef8-45dc-a6fd-e70cb5a03e5e-1024x593.jpg" alt="The 7 Best Gig Economy Apps for Couriers to Make More Money: Dolly app" class="wp-image-3260" srcset="https://wordpress.getcircuit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/99c9baea-aef8-45dc-a6fd-e70cb5a03e5e-1024x593.jpg 1024w, https://wordpress.getcircuit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/99c9baea-aef8-45dc-a6fd-e70cb5a03e5e-300x174.jpg 300w, https://wordpress.getcircuit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/99c9baea-aef8-45dc-a6fd-e70cb5a03e5e-768x445.jpg 768w, https://wordpress.getcircuit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/99c9baea-aef8-45dc-a6fd-e70cb5a03e5e-1536x890.jpg 1536w, https://wordpress.getcircuit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/99c9baea-aef8-45dc-a6fd-e70cb5a03e5e-2048x1186.jpg 2048w, https://wordpress.getcircuit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/99c9baea-aef8-45dc-a6fd-e70cb5a03e5e-1200x695.jpg 1200w, https://wordpress.getcircuit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/99c9baea-aef8-45dc-a6fd-e70cb5a03e5e-1980x1147.jpg 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>If you&#8217;re able-bodied and have a truck or van, you&#8217;re sure to find great gigs at Dolly. As a &#8220;helper,&#8221; you&#8217;ll be helping small businesses and retailers fulfill their delivery. You&#8217;ll also assist individuals and families who are moving to another city or state.</p>



<p>Big retailers like Costco and Lowe&#8217;s hire Dolly helpers whenever they get swamped with deliveries or during peak season.</p>



<p>If you own a van, truck, or trailer, you can earn $30 or more per hour as a helper. The app is entirely free, and you won&#8217;t get any deductions for fees. You&#8217;ll receive weekly payments through PayPal, and if you get a tip, you get to keep 100%.</p>



<p>The qualifications to become part of Dolly are:</p>



<ul><li>21 years and older</li><li>Valid driver&#8217;s license</li><li>Qualifying vehicle with auto insurance</li><li>Able to lift at least 75 lbs.</li><li>Must pass a background check</li></ul>



<p>Dolly will allow you to have &#8220;assistants&#8221; who can help you with the lifting. They get no additional pay, though, so you&#8217;ll have to share your earnings with them.</p>



<p>Compared to other moving sites, Dolly gives insurance coverage to customers while their items are in transit. What&#8217;s great about this is that you won&#8217;t be liable or held responsible if something breaks or gets damaged while you&#8217;re moving the items.</p>



<p>The signup process for Dolly is simple. You only need to fill out the form with your name, email, phone, and date of birth. Plus, you need to provide information about your vehicle and add your availability. Finally, you&#8217;ll have to upload your picture and provide information from your driver&#8217;s license.</p>



<p>Application approval takes five to 10 days. After which, you&#8217;ll be able to view available gigs in your area.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dolly is one of the great gig economy apps that helps you get courier work, but you&#8217;ll need to be physically fit or have someone do the lifting for you. The $35+ hour pay plus tip makes this a profitable side-hustle.</p>

<p>To be successful in this gig economy, you need to accommodate other jobs as well. Handy can be a great option if the courier service in your area is in a dry spell or you just want to add other gigs for extra income.</p>



<p>The Handy app connects customers with &#8220;professionals&#8221; to provide all sorts of home services. You can get gigs for furniture assembly, handyman services, and even TV mounting.</p>



<p>The pay varies depending on the job you&#8217;re going to take. If you&#8217;re good at doing work as a handyman, you can earn up to $45 per hour. Handy deposits your payment to your bank account as soon as you complete the job.</p>



<p>Requirements to become a Handy professional are easy to fulfill:</p>



<ul><li>Have a smartphone for their app</li><li>Complete and pass a background check</li><li>Have your own reliable transportation</li><li>Must have your own tools</li></ul>



<p>Once you become a Handy professional, you need to be very punctual with your scheduled jobs. Handy will deduct $15 from your pay if you show up late. If you decide to reschedule or cancel, they can cut $10 to $50 from your earnings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Handy is one of the best gig economy apps at its simplest form – you just need to choose a job from the app, complete it, then get paid. There is no insurance coverage, though, and you have to bring your own tools. But if you want to quickly get paid after completing each job, Handy is a great pick.</p>
